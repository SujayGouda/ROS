#### IMU:

Built-in Gazebo plugin for inertial measurement unit (IMU) is interfaced for determining robots orientation, linear acceleration, angular velocity

#### Laser Scanner:

Built-in Gazebo plugin for Laser scanner is interfaced  to detect any objects shape, size, orientation, distance, relative motion / relative velocity
